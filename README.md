# Ritu iOS App

## Description
FastAPI-based API backend for Ritu, a mobile app & SMS system that generates 7-day pest & weather projections, enabling farmers to minimize disease spread & crop loss. Hosted on DigitalOcean.

The Ritu API powers the mobile app and SMS system. It leverages the Twilio API to send SMS text messages to users, making Ritu extremely accessible. The API sends weekly crop predictions to both the mobile app and a user's phone via SMS.
